## Proposal/Overview

In order for Estuary to support more users, we need to build tools that will make it easy for anyone to integrate it. One of the best ways to do this is by creating a component that will enable a mountable file system on an operating sytsem thatâ€™s backed by EstuaryAPI.

## Solution

We need to build a component that will allow systems to mount Estuary as a storage. This can be a ESTSF that calls the Estuary API to store files and/or folders. 

## Assumptions
