# FVM Website Hero Animation

<aside>
ℹ️ **Overview**
We’d like to create a hero animation for the new [Filecoin Virtual Machine website](https://fvm.filecoin.io/).

## Deliverables

Infinite looping animation in the smallest byte size web video format that allows for white text to be overlayed.

Notes

- There is already a theme and brand style for the website, I would just make use of the assets in the two Figma files provided and not try to deviate too much.
- You can be confident the background hex: **#0a0c15**; is here to stay.
- Don’t include the text in the loop because we may change the text.

### Visual References

This is a good example, without the loading (but webgl i think)

Or something similar to this, but looping

# Version 2 - Updates

Call notes:

- create 3-5 permutation animations (depending on cost) to add to the array that we pull from
- add color options (and transparent lines if possible) from the figma
- Re: placement - referring to the visual references below, is it possible to make the placement of the nodes more sim-city like?
- any clever addition variations we can add to help it feel more lively (or random) would be cool. Thinking animation speed or random seed noises to the animation, stuff like that.
- not all permutations need to morph into the FVM lockup
- see notes below about gradients & designs

### Previous notes from V1:

**Animation**

- Is it possible to set up a couple of different animations, specifically thinking about seeing this with some easing vs linear, vs impact? This one is linear which actually makes a lot of sense for the mechanical nature, but I'd love to see one with some updated curves.
    - Additionally - some panels appear instantly and then extrude. It could be cool to instead have a panel appear as a very-small square that grows outward before extruding. Like a portal opening.
- It seems like this is hand animated - possible to add options for more permutations like we see in the figma? (please educate me on what this would entail)

**Designs**

- Please integrate the thin-line see-thru “screens” for depth and variety
    - These are the variations we spoke about that are representative of enterprise storage providers, page 2 of the figma
- Let's add the color options (based on the figma illustration)
- It seems like there's interest in having a 'floor' or grid for the isometric layout - is it possible to line them up in a way that they sit on the 'floor' or does that have to be custom?
- Builds from wireframe could be interesting, with individual lines drawing at various rates
- Is it possible to resize gradients along the isometric axes, so they’re parallel to the edges of the objects (see Agata’s art)
