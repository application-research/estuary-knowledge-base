- still taking in deals from Estuary
- sometimes functions really well, but other times really slow
- Closing off Estuary is probably b/c it’s been used as a testing ground
    - seems like it is been used heavily for testing
    - Estuary doesn’t care that much if the deal functions or not, or if it finishes at all
    - minerX, SPX, were prepared for things to fail and clean it up
    - if you’re going to more production storage miners, unwilling to clean up things
- Slingshot repair program - taken a lot of energy from storage providers
    - difference between online and offline
    - offline - can optimize according to your cluster and download data at specific intervals
    - can actually have a pipeline of data transfers going on, and then you cacn say I want to seal a sector of deals now, and then every 5 min import to the storage provider / miner
- Since you’re sending out data regardless of size, can be deal with 1GB, 2GB, 4GB... SP currently take the cost of storage deals. base cost rising as it is now, doesn’t make sense to take deals that are under 1 GB
    - other parties you can import offline deal with 32 GB, much more efficient
        - bidbot
        - dealbot
        - Slingshot programs
    - from SP perspective, want to pack sectors as full as possible, hard if you are getting small deals
    - optimizing space is one of the big pain points
- certain times when Estuary is sending out a lot of deals, and you don’t know when the deals will come
    - on SP side, you can’t prepare for it
    - you could rate limit it - since sealing cluster can’t handle it time, need to reject deals
    - can’t get the data and start sealing it later
- transfer speed in general can be hard as well
- bidbot
    - manually import after data transfer
- Estuary needs to start bundling data together - really good start
    - saves a lot of gas for SPs
    - send less messages to chain to get same amt of verified deals
    - base fee increasing → exponentially more expensive to publish messages
- testing vs production separate
    - safeguards as a SP if a client tries to overwhelm
    - how much does Estuary scale
