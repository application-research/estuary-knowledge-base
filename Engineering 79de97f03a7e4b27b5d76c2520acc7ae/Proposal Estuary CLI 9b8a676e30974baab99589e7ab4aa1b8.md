## Proposal/Overview

A complete Estuary CLI similar to Kubo. We would need to add the same functionality as kubo (add, pin) plus our own functionality - collections, peering, autoretrieve, makedeal, replication etc.

## Consideration

We can probably merge this with the EstuaryFS where in the CLI, we can use it as the FS daemon to mount the filesystem.

## Technical Design

## Testing

## Edge cases

## Deliverables / Definition of Done

- [ ]  Code changes (Code/UT)
- [ ]  SQL File to add the new table
- [ ]  Swagger documentation changes
- [ ]  Documentation changes
